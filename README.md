# Nev-R-Empty

Title: Nev-R-Empty Fridge

Description: This program will allow anyone with items that have an expiration date of some sort, to track these items. Users may enter the item, the quantity (or measurement), and the expiration date. This program will be focused on a fridge, so users will know when they need to toss out and get some more of a specific food item. This will allow people to prepare for meals ahead of time instead of making a last minute run to the grocery store for some milk!
